  <div class="medium-6 columns">Pattern formation is a characteristic of complex
non-linear systems driven away from equilibrium. One of the best known examples
of this is convection, which in the idealized case gives origin to a regular, grid-like
pattern of hexagonal cells. In more realistic scenarios, such as the buoyancy-driven
turbulent convection we find in our atmosphere, the geometric regularity of this pattern
is destroyed, which limits our ability to characterize it in terms of its metric structure.
Despite the apparent randomness introduced by turbulent motions, however, the up- and
downdrafts which make up the convective cells do have a well-defined pattern, which can
be best described by topological invariants of subdomains of the flow.

  <div class="medium-6 columns">The convective planetary boundary layer (CBL) is the
transition zone that mediates the exchange of energy between the surface of the
Earth and its atmosphere. Buoyancy-driven turbulence results in the hierarchical organization
of updrafts into large-scale convective plumes that can span the entire CBL depth, and are characteristic
examples of <i>coherent structures</i>. Such structures are defined in terms of connectivity
in space and time. Because connectivity is a fundamental topological property that can be
computed efficiently, the precise location and size of these structures, as well as their hierarchical
organization, can be determined directly in data produced by numerical simulations of the CBL. This
analysis is commonly done by means of spectral analysis, but a connectivity-based approach
has the distinct advantage of identifying where the convective plumes are connected to the land surface.
This enables a quantitative analysis of the effect of land-surface heterogeneity in both modulating
the rate of plume coalescence in the atmosphere, and in modifying the relative effectiveness of different
surface types in sustaining convection.</div>

  <div class="medium-6 columns">The distribution of objects in space can be characterized quantitatively
  by first-order statistics, such as the nearest-neighbor distribution, or by second-order statistics,
such as Ripley's K and L functions. Persistent homology, one of the most popular tools in topological
data analysis, can also be used as a statistic for the analysis of spatial distributions. This is
especially clear if we use a related object, the stable rank invariant of persistence modules,
which can be interpreted as a cumulative density function for the appearance and disappearance of
topological features over a range of spatial scales. This has greater discriminatory power than first-
or second-order statistics, for the case of spatial point patterns. For the study of the spatial
distribution of boundary layer clouds, this invariant can be used to define an index of spatial
organization.
